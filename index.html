        <p class="article-text">Nicaragua has cancelled operating permits for six NGOs from the United States and Europe, days after President Daniel Ortega’s government faced sanctions for arresting prominent political opponents.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Oxfam, as well as the US-based National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, were among the groups affected, according to the official government gazette.</p>

        <p class="article-text">The mostly online retailer leans on a vast network of celebrities, influencers, and random selfie takers who post about the brand relentlessly on social media. It is built to satisfy a very online clientele, mass-producing cheap clothes that look expensive.</p>
        <p class="article-text">“They need to buy a lot of different styles and probably only wear them a couple times so their Instagram feeds can stay fresh,” Richard Saghian, Fashion Nova’s founder, said in an interview last year. </p>

            <p class="article-text">Books have a firing point at 456 Farenheit. This book talks about a story where firefigthers burn books instead of extinguishing fires. All books are banned an should be burned so no one can read them</p>
            <p class="article-text">We recommend reading this book because it shows a different perspective of how everything would be if we didn't have books. Would people bootleg them as they did with alcohol? It should be interesting to know what would happen in today's world.</p>
